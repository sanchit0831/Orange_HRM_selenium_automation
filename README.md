## 📌 About The Project

This automation suite covers key HR operations including adding, searching, and deleting employee records:

### 1. 👤 Adding an Employee
- The automation script navigates to the **"Add Employee"** form.
- Inputs required fields like **first name, last name, employee ID**, and uploads a profile photo if needed.
- Submits the form and validates successful addition.

### 2. 🔍 Searching for an Employee
- Searches for the newly added employee using name or employee ID.
- Verifies that the employee appears correctly in the search results.

### 3. ❌ Deleting an Employee
- Selects the employee from the list.
- Deletes the employee record and confirms that it no longer appears in the system.
